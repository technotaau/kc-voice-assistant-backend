"Padhai me time kam, understanding zyada - yahi hai speed reading ka funda!" - KC

## Current Speed Test Karo

### How to Test Your Speed
1. Select any paragraph (200 words)
2. Time yourself
3. Calculate: Words ÷ Time (in minutes) = WPM
4. Test comprehension with 5 questions

**Baseline Note Karo**: This is your starting point!

## Bad Reading Habits - Inhe Todna Hoga!

### 1. Subvocalization (Mental Pronunciation)
**Problem**: Mind me har word bolna
**Solution**: Tongue ko palate se touch karke rakho while reading

### 2. Regression (Re-reading)
**Problem**: Baar baar same line padhna
**Solution**: Use finger/pen as pacer, no going back

### 3. Word-by-Word Reading
**Problem**: Ek ek word pe focus
**Solution**: Read in chunks (3-4 words together)

### 4. Poor Focus
**Problem**: Mind wandering while reading
**Solution**: 25-minute focused sessions with breaks

## Core Techniques - Master These!

### Technique 1: Chunking Method
Instead of: "The | boy | went | to | the | market"
Read as: "The boy went | to the market"

**Practice Exercise**:
- Start with 2-word chunks
- Move to 3-word chunks
- Advanced: Full phrase chunks

### Technique 2: Peripheral Vision Training
**Expand your vision span:**
```
    [Focus Point]
[Left Peripheral] X [Right Peripheral]
```

**Training Method**:
1. Focus on center word
2. Try to see words on sides without moving eyes
3. Gradually expand range

### Technique 3: The Pointer Method
**Use your finger/pen:**
- Move smoothly under lines
- Gradually increase speed
- Don't stop or go back
- Let eyes follow the pointer

**Speed Progression**:
- Week 1: Comfortable speed
- Week 2: 10% faster
- Week 3: 20% faster
- Week 4: 30% faster

### Technique 4: Skimming and Scanning

**Skimming** (for general idea):
- Read first and last sentence of paragraphs
- Focus on headings and bold text
- Look for keywords
- Speed: 700-1000 WPM

**Scanning** (for specific info):
- Know what you're looking for
- Let eyes jump around page
- Stop only at relevant parts
- Speed: 1000+ WPM

## Advanced Techniques

#### 1. The Snake Pattern
```

## Final Mastery Tips from KC

"Speed reading is like driving - initially scary, then natural. Practice daily, push comfort zone, but never sacrifice understanding for speed."

**Remember the Formula**:
Perfect Practice + Gradual Progress = Permanent Performance

**Golden Rules**:
1. Comprehension > Speed initially
2. Different materials need different speeds
3. Physical comfort matters (posture, lighting)
4. Regular breaks prevent fatigue
5. Track progress for motivation

"Ab aap 3 ghante ka reading 1 ghante me kar sakte ho. Time bachao, knowledge badhao!"
